# Algorithms

Set of steps to solving a problem

### How to measure efficiency

Checking time isn’t the computer science approach because dfferent time results on different computers with different programming languages.

We use **Asymtotic Analysis** to Check the efficiency and correctness of algorithm allowing us to think independently of hardware and programminng language

### Correctness
Algorithm resulting in correct answer or best answer (Perfect algorithms take a lot of time)
### Efficient
Algorithm that gives good but not best result in minimum time.

Case Scenerios to know about:

•	Best case
•	Average case
•	Worse case
