# Algorithms

Set of steps to solving a problem

### How to measure efficiency

Checking time isn’t the computer science approach because dfferent time results on different computers with different inputs.

We use #### Asymtotic Analysis ###### to Check the efficiency and correctness of algorithm

#### Correctness
Algorithm resulting in correct answer or best answer (Perfect algorithms take a lot of time)
#### Efficient
Algorithm that gives good but not best result in minimum time.

Some terms to think about before proceeding
•	Best case
•	Average case
•	Worse case
