# Algorithms

Set of steps to solving a problem

### How to measure efficiency

Checking time isnâ€™t the computer science approach because dfferent time results on different computers with different programming languages.

We use **Asymtotic Analysis** to Check the efficiency and correctness of algorithm allowing us to think independently of hardware and programminng language

### Correctness
Algorithm resulting in correct answer or best answer (Perfect algorithms take a lot of time)
### Efficient
Algorithm that gives good but not best result in minimum time.

Case Scenerios to know about:

*	Best case

*	Average case

*	Worse case

# Guessing Game

[Play Game](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/intro-to-algorithms/a/a-guessing-game)
(You'll need account of khan academy to access)

Given a **sorted list** computer guessed a random number from it.
We search that number given the computer tells us if the guessed number is larger or smaller than our selected value.

# Linear Search
Searching the list from 0th index to the end in order is linear search.
Best, Worse and average case scenerio depends on luck for this matter.

**For example:** For a list of **2000000 elements**
Computer selects 1 and you get the number on your first guess. **(Best Case)**

Computer selects 2000000, you would need 2000000 guesses
