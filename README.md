# Design & Analysis Of Algorithms
Creating some notes about algorithms.

The first part is the introduction.

## [Introduction](https://github.com/Habib0308/Design-Analysis-Of-Algorithms/blob/master/Notes/Introduction.md)

Introduction Contains the following topics:

How to measure **Correctness & Efficiency** of an algorithm?

What is **Asymptotic Analysis** ([For Detailed Notes](https://github.com/Habib0308/Design-Analysis-Of-Algorithms/blob/master/Notes/Asymptotic%20Analysis.md))

Cases to analyze an algorithm:

* Best case
* Average case
* Worse case

We will do a Comparison b/w two Algorithms with a Searching problem to understand how an algorithm is Efficient over the other with some case scenerios.

The Algorithms we are gonna use are:
* Linear Search
* [Binary Search](https://github.com/Habib0308/Design-Analysis-Of-Algorithms/blob/master/Algorithms%20in%20Python/Binary%20Search.md)

After Introduction We study:
## [Asymptotic Analysis](https://github.com/Habib0308/Design-Analysis-Of-Algorithms/blob/master/Notes/Asymptotic%20Analysis.md)
We cover the following topics:
Asymptotic Notations
Big-Oh(O) notation
Big-Omega(Ω) notation
Big-Theta(Θ) notation
Order of Complexity
Rules for Big Oh Notations
Big-Oh(O) Notations in Details:
O(1)
O(log(n))
O((log(n<sup>c</sup>)) (Not yet)
O(n)
O(n<sup>2</sup>)
O(n<sup>c</sup>)
O(c<sup>n</sup>)
