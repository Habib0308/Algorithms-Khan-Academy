# Design & Analysis Of Algorithms
Creating some notes about algorithms.

The first part is the introduction.

## [Introduction](https://github.com/Habib0308/Algorithms-Khan-Academy/blob/master/Intoduction/Algorithms.md)

Introduction Contains the following topics:

How to measure **Correctness & Efficiency** of an algorithm?

**Asymtotic Analysis** ([Click Here For Notes](https://github.com/Habib0308/Design-Analysis-Of-Algorithms/blob/master/Notes/Asymtotic%20Analysis.md))

Cases to analyze an algorithm:

* Best case
* Average case
* Worse case

For an introductory we will do an Algorithm Comparison with a Searching problem. We will understand how an algorithm is Efficient over the other with the some case scenerios.

The Algorithms we are gonna use are:
* Linear Search
* Binary Search
