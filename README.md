# Design & Analysis Of Algorithms
Creating some notes about algorithms.

The first part is the introduction.

## [Introduction](https://github.com/Habib0308/Design-Analysis-Of-Algorithms/blob/master/Notes/Introduction.md)

Introduction Contains the following topics:

How to measure **Correctness & Efficiency** of an algorithm?

What is **Asymtotic Analysis** ([For Detailed Notes](https://github.com/Habib0308/Design-Analysis-Of-Algorithms/blob/master/Notes/Asymtotic%20Analysis.md))

Cases to analyze an algorithm:

* Best case
* Average case
* Worse case

We will do a Comparison b/w two Algorithms with a Searching problem to understand how an algorithm is Efficient over the other with some case scenerios.

The Algorithms we are gonna use are:
* Linear Search
* Binary Search
