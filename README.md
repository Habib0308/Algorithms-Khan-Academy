# Algorithms-Khan-Academy
Creating some notes from khan academy about algorithms.

The first part is the introduction.

## [Introduction](https://github.com/Habib0308/Algorithms-Khan-Academy/blob/master/Intoduction/Algorithms.md)

Introduction Contains the following topics:

How to measure efficiency
* Correctness
* Efficiency
Case Scenerios to know about:

* Best case
* Average case
* Worse case

With the help of a guessing game we will understand how an algorithm is Efficient over the other with the above case scenerios.
* Linear Search
* Binary Search
