# Algorithms (Khan Academy)
Creating some notes from khan academy about algorithms.

The first part is the introduction.

## [Introduction](https://github.com/Habib0308/Algorithms-Khan-Academy/blob/master/Intoduction/Algorithms.md)

Introduction Contains the following topics:

How do we actually measure Correctness & Efficiency of an algorithm in computer science.

Cases to analyze an algorithm:

* Best case
* Average case
* Worse case

We will than do an Algorithm Comparison with a given Searching problem 

We will understand how an algorithm is Efficient over the other with the above case scenerios.

The Algorithms we are gonna use are:
* Linear Search
* Binary Search


# Binary Search Algorithm
