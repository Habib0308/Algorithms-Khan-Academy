# Asymtotic Analysis
In Asymptotic Analysis, we evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of input size (we don’t measure the actual running time). We calculate, how the time (or space) taken by an algorithm increases with the input size.

## Asymptotic Notations
Mathematical way of representing time complexity.

We check how many number of times a statement is executed by some notations.

The three notations for three types of cases:
* Big-Oh(O) notation
* Big-Theta(Θ) notation
* Big-Omega(Ω) notation
### Big-Oh(O) notation
It always represents upper bound.

* Ignores constants
* Ignores lower order terms
* Mostly used
* Least Upper bound
* Worse Case
### Big-Omega(Ω) notation
* Lower Bound
* Best Case
### Big-Theta(Θ) notation
* Average Bound
* Average Case

# Big-Oh(O)
f(n)= 2n^2 + n
